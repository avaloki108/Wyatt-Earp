        Analyze this bridge contract for cross-chain vulnerabilities. Focus on:

        BRIDGE CONTRACT CODE:
        {contract_code}

        {f'BRIDGE CONTEXT: {bridge_context}' if bridge_context else ''}

        Look for these specific bridge attack patterns:

        1. **Message Validation Flaws**:
           - Insufficient signature verification
           - Weak Merkle proof validation
           - Default value exploitation (like Nomad's confirmAt[0] issue)
           - Message replay protection failures

        2. **Initialization & Setup Issues**:
           - Uninitialized critical variables
           - Improper guardian setup
           - Default value assumptions in mappings

        3. **Legacy Code Exploitation**:
           - Deprecated functions still callable
           - Old deposit methods that bypass new logic
           - Backwards compatibility issues

        4. **Cross-Chain Timing Attacks**:
           - Message ordering dependencies
           - Race conditions between chains
           - Time-based validation weaknesses

        5. **Economic/Logic Flaws**:
           - Minting without proper backing
           - Fee bypass mechanisms
           - Token standard assumption violations

        For each potential vulnerability:
        - Explain the attack scenario
        - Show the specific code that enables it
        - Suggest how to fix it
        - Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

        Focus on novel attack vectors that automated tools might miss.

           - Stale price usage
           - Oracle dependency assumptions

        5. **Access Control Logic**:
           - Role transition vulnerabilities
           - Permission escalation paths
           - Emergency function abuse

        6. **Mathematical/Precision Issues**:
           - Rounding error exploitation
           - Overflow/underflow in calculations
           - Division by zero edge cases
