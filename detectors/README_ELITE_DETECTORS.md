# Elite Web3 Vulnerability Detectors üéØ

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Elite Web3 Bug Hunter  
**License:** MIT

## Overview

This suite contains **4 elite-tier vulnerability detectors** designed to find the bugs that traditional scanners miss. These detectors focus on **novel, human-only vulnerability patterns** that require deep reasoning about:

- Multi-transaction state flows
- Economic attack viability
- Cross-contract interactions
- Time-based logic flaws

### Why These Detectors?

Traditional tools like Slither, Mythril, and Echidna are excellent at finding:
- ‚úÖ Reentrancy
- ‚úÖ Integer overflows
- ‚úÖ Access control issues
- ‚úÖ Uninitialized storage

But they **MISS** these high-value bugs:
- ‚ùå Storage collisions in proxy patterns
- ‚ùå Economically viable flash loan attacks
- ‚ùå Oracle staleness exploitation
- ‚ùå Multi-block state desynchronization

**These detectors find those bugs.**

## üî• The Four Elite Detectors

### 1. üóÑÔ∏è Storage Collision Detector

**Finds:** Storage slot collisions in proxy patterns, inheritance chains, and delegatecall contexts.

**What it detects:**
- Proxy/Implementation storage layout mismatches
- Multiple inheritance storage conflicts (C3 linearization issues)
- Unstructured storage misuse
- Delegatecall storage overwrites
- Assembly storage manipulation risks

**Why it matters:**  
Storage collisions can allow attackers to overwrite critical state variables like `owner`, `balances`, or `totalSupply`, leading to complete protocol takeover.

**Example vulnerability:**
```solidity
// Proxy contract
contract Proxy {
    address public implementation;  // slot 0
}

// Implementation contract
contract Logic {
    address public owner;  // slot 0 - COLLISION!
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python detectors/storage_collision_detector.py /path/to/contracts
```

### 2. üí∞ Flash Loan Economic Simulator

**Finds:** Economically viable flash loan attacks with profitability analysis.

**What it detects:**
- Oracle manipulation via flash loans
- Governance voting power attacks
- Collateral ratio manipulation
- Liquidity pool price manipulation
- Vault share price inflation/deflation
- Reward claiming exploits

**Why it matters:**  
Not all flash loan attacks are profitable. This detector **simulates the economics** to find attacks where:
```
Potential Profit - (Flash Loan Fee + Gas Cost) > 0
```

**Example vulnerability:**
```solidity
function borrow() external {
    uint price = getSpotPrice();  // ‚ùå Uses spot price
    uint collateralValue = collateral * price;
    // Attacker can manipulate price with flash loan
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "manipulation_cost": "$10,000",
  "potential_profit": "$150,000",
  "net_profit": "$140,000",
  "attack_complexity": "low",
  "success_probability": 0.85
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python detectors/flash_loan_simulator.py /path/to/contracts
```

### 3. üîÑ Multi-TX State Desync Analyzer

**Finds:** State synchronization issues across transactions and blocks.

**What it detects:**
- Oracle prices used without staleness checks
- State assumptions invalidated between transactions
- Cross-block race conditions
- Time-lagged state dependencies
- Check-effect-interaction patterns across blocks
- Atomic operation assumptions that aren't atomic

**Why it matters:**  
Most contracts assume state changes are instantaneous or synchronized. In reality:
```
Block N:   Oracle updates to $2000
Block N+5: Market crashes to $1500
Block N+5: Oracle still shows $2000 (STALE!)
Block N+5: Attacker exploits the $500 gap
```

**Example vulnerability:**
```solidity
function liquidate(address user) external {
    uint price = oracle.getPrice();  // ‚ùå No staleness check
    require(isUnderwater(user, price));
    // Between check and execution, price can change!
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python detectors/state_desync_analyzer.py /path/to/contracts
```

---

### 4. üîÆ Oracle Manipulation Detector

**Finds:** Oracle manipulation vectors and price feed vulnerabilities.

**What it detects:**
- Spot price manipulation from DEX
- TWAP manipulation (short window)
- Chainlink oracle misuse
- Single oracle dependency (no redundancy)
- Missing circuit breakers
- Flash loan oracle attacks
- Cross-oracle arbitrage

**Why it matters:**  
Oracle manipulation is a **top-tier exploit**:
- Harvest Finance: $24M lost
- Mango Markets: $114M lost
- bZx: Multiple attacks

**Example vulnerability:**
```solidity
function getPrice() public view returns (uint) {
    (uint reserve0, uint reserve1, ) = pair.getReserves();
    return reserve1 * 1e18 / reserve0;  // ‚ùå Spot price!
}
```

**Attack scenario:**
1. Flash loan $1M ‚Üí Swap in DEX ‚Üí Price manipulated 50%
2. Call vulnerable function with inflated price
3. Extract value ‚Üí Reverse swap ‚Üí Repay loan
4. **Profit: $49,100** (after fees)

**Usage:**
```bash
python detectors/oracle_manipulation_detector.py /path/to/contracts
```

## üî¨ What Makes These "Elite"?

### Traditional Scanner:
```
Found: "Assembly block uses sstore"
Severity: Medium
Confidence: 60%
```

### Elite Detector:
```
Found: "Storage collision in proxy pattern - slot 0 overwrite"
Severity: CRITICAL
Confidence: 95%

Attack Scenario:
1. Attacker identifies slot 0 collision between proxy.owner and logic.totalSupply
2. Calls logic function that writes to totalSupply
3. Due to delegatecall, write overwrites proxy.owner
4. Attacker becomes owner
5. Drains entire protocol

Economic Impact: $10M TVL at risk
Exploitability: HIGH
Remediation: Align storage layouts, add storage gaps
```
