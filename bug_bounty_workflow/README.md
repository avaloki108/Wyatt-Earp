## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Disproof Council
The Disproof Council is a rigorous validation system that ensures only high-quality findings proceed:

1. **Validators** attempt to reproduce PoCs
2. **Skeptics** attack assumptions and refute weak claims
3. **Adversaries** test real-world exploitability
4. **Max 3 rounds** per finding to prevent cycles
5. **Only surviving findings** proceed to mastermind

### Mastermind Synthesis
The Mastermind serves as the final logic arbiter:

- **Not a hunter** — it synthesizes findings
- **Only runs after** Disproof Council + economic analysis
- **Can discover new criticals** not found by hunters
- **Output is immutable** truth for reporters
- **Bounty-ready** report generation

### Economic Analysis
Dual-mode financial analysis:

- **Phase 2 (lite mode)**: Bounty priors for hunters
- **Phase 8 (deep mode)**: Capital requirements and profitability
- **MEV opportunities** and economic impact
- **Platform-specific** optimization
