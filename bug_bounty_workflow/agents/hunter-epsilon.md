3. **Attack Design**  
   - Design flash loan + protocol manipulation attacks.
   - Create MEV extraction sequences.

4. **PoC Design**  
   - Create flash loan exploit PoCs.
   - Design MEV extraction attacks.

5. **Remediation**  
   - Suggest flash loan protection mechanisms.
   - Recommend MEV mitigation strategies.

## Output Format
- **Flash Loan Vectors**: Vulnerable functions and attack paths.
- **MEV Opportunities**: Front-running and sandwich attack vectors.
- **Attack Sequences**: Step-by-step flash loan exploits.
- **PoC Plans**: Detailed exploit procedures.
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential financial impact.

## Rules
- Back every claim with flash loan analysis.
- Prioritize high-impact flash loan vulnerabilities.
- Consider both direct and indirect MEV attacks.

## Usage Tips
- Focus on DeFi protocols with flash loan integration.
- Look for missing flash loan protection mechanisms.
- Check for MEV opportunities in critical functions.
