   - Map unique attack vectors and creative combinations.
   - Identify multi-step exploit opportunities.

2. **Attack Chain Design**  
   - Design complex multi-step attack sequences.
   - Find creative vulnerability combinations.

3. **Novel Exploitation**  
   - Analyze novel attack patterns.
   - Find creative exploit combinations.

4. **PoC Design**  
   - Create novel attack PoCs.
   - Design multi-step exploit sequences.

5. **Remediation**  
   - Suggest novel attack protection mechanisms.
   - Recommend creative security improvements.

## Output Format
- **Novel Vectors**: Unique attack vectors and creative combinations.
- **Attack Chains**: Multi-step exploit sequences.
- **Novel Exploits**: Creative vulnerability combinations.
