# Cross-Contract Analysis

## Overview

The **Cross-Contract Analysis** module analyzes multiple smart contracts together to find vulnerabilities that only appear when considering contract interactions, dependencies, and protocol-wide business logic.

## What's New? üöÄ

Traditional tools analyze contracts **one at a time**, missing critical issues that span multiple contracts. Our cross-contract analyzer:

- ‚úÖ **Loads all contracts** in your project simultaneously
- ‚úÖ **Builds cross-contract call graphs** showing how contracts interact
- ‚úÖ **Tracks state dependencies** across contracts
- ‚úÖ **Validates protocol-wide business logic** and invariants
- ‚úÖ **Finds vulnerabilities** that require understanding multiple contracts together

## Usage

### Analyze a Directory

```bash
# Analyze all contracts in a directory
./hunt contracts/

# Analyze entire project
./hunt ~/projects/my-defi-protocol/
```

When you point the tool at a **directory** instead of a single file, it automatically:
1. Loads all `.sol` files in the directory (recursively)
2. Parses contract structures and relationships
3. Builds cross-contract call graph
4. Detects cross-contract vulnerabilities
5. Validates protocol-wide business logic

### Analyze Single Contract (Traditional)

```bash
# Single contract analysis (no cross-contract features)
./hunt contracts/Token.sol
```

## Vulnerabilities Detected

### 1. Cross-Contract Reentrancy Chain ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**What it finds:**
- Contract A calls Contract B
- Contract B can call back to Contract A
- Contract A modifies state after the external call

**Real-world impact:** Lendf.me hack ($25M), DAO hack ($60M)

**Example:**
```solidity
// Contract A
function withdraw() external {
    pool.notifyWithdraw(msg.sender);  // Calls Contract B
    balances[msg.sender] = 0;         // State change AFTER call
}

// Contract B (Malicious)
function notifyWithdraw(address user) external {
    ContractA(msg.sender).withdraw(); // Re-enters!
}
```

### 2. Privilege Escalation via External Call ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**What it finds:**
- Protected function calls unprotected external function
- External function can modify important state
- Attacker bypasses access control

**Example:**
```solidity
// Contract A
function adminTransfer() external onlyOwner {
    token.transfer(recipient, amount);  // Calls unprotected function
}

// Contract B
function transfer() external {  // No access control!
    // Anyone can call this directly
}
```

### 3. State Inconsistency ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**What it finds:**
- Multiple contracts modify similar state variables
- Updates are not properly synchronized
- State can become inconsistent

**Example:**
```solidity
// Contract A
uint256 public totalBalance;

// Contract B  
uint256 public totalBalance;

// Both contracts update their totalBalance independently
// Can lead to accounting errors
```

### 4. Unsafe Delegatecall ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**What it finds:**
- Delegatecall with user-controlled target address
- Allows arbitrary code execution

**Real-world impact:** Parity Wallet hack ($150M)

**Example:**
```solidity
function execute(address target, bytes memory data) external {
    target.delegatecall(data);  // DANGEROUS!
}
```

### 5. Flash Loan Attack Vector ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**What it finds:**
- Functions that read balance/reserves
- No reentrancy protection
- Can be exploited with flash loans

**Real-world impact:** Harvest Finance ($34M), Cream Finance ($130M)

### 6. Sandwich Attack Opportunity ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**What it finds:**
- Functions that modify price/exchange rate
- No slippage protection
- Vulnerable to MEV attacks

**Real-world impact:** $1B+ lost to MEV in 2021-2023

### 7. Access Control Bypass ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**What it finds:**
- Critical state can be modified via multiple paths
- Some paths have weaker access control
- Attacker can bypass intended restrictions

### 8. Circular Dependencies ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

**What it finds:**
- Contract A depends on Contract B
- Contract B depends on Contract A
- Creates deployment and upgrade issues

### 9. Proxy Storage Collision ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**What it finds:**
- Storage variable conflicts in proxy patterns
- Can cause state corruption

**Real-world impact:** Audius hack ($6M)

### 10. Business Logic Violations ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**What it finds:**
- Supply invariant violations (mint/burn doesn't update totalSupply)
- Balance validation missing (withdraw without balance check)
- Inconsistent access control patterns
- Re-initialization vulnerabilities

**Real-world impact:** Wormhole hack ($325M)

## Architecture

### How It Works

```
1. Load Phase
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Find all .sol files in directory
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Parse each contract
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Extract structure (functions, state vars, calls)

2. Analysis Phase
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build call graph (cross-contract calls)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analyze dependencies
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Track state access patterns
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Map privilege boundaries

3. Detection Phase
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Detect reentrancy chains
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Find privilege escalation paths
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check state consistency
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validate business logic
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Check invariants

4. Reporting Phase
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rank by severity & confidence
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate exploit paths
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Provide remediation advice
```

### Call Graph Structure

```
Pool.deposit
  ‚îî‚îÄ> Token.transferFrom (external call)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Pool.updateBalance (callback)
            ‚îî‚îÄ> REENTRANCY DETECTED!
```

## Comparison: Single vs Cross-Contract

| Feature | Single Contract | Cross-Contract |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Reentrancy within contract | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Reentrancy across contracts | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Privilege escalation | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| State inconsistency | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Business logic validation | Partial | ‚úÖ Full |
| Protocol-wide invariants | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Access control bypass | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## Best Practices

### 1. Run Both Analyses

```bash
# First: Cross-contract analysis on the directory
./hunt contracts/

# Then: Detailed analysis on critical contracts
./hunt contracts/Pool.sol
./hunt contracts/Token.sol
```

### 2. Focus on Critical Paths

Pay special attention to:
- External calls between contracts
- Functions with access control modifiers
- State variables modified by multiple contracts
- Proxy/upgradeable patterns

### 3. Validate Business Logic

The tool checks common invariants, but you should also verify:
- Your specific protocol rules
- Economic incentive alignment
- Edge cases in multi-step operations

### 4. Review Call Graphs

Examine the call graph output to understand:
- Which contracts are tightly coupled
- Where circular dependencies exist
- Critical interaction points

## Examples

### Example 1: DeFi Protocol

```bash
./hunt ~/projects/my-defi/contracts/

# Finds:
# - Reentrancy in Pool -> Token callback
# - Flash loan vector in price oracle
# - Access control bypass in reward distribution
```

### Example 2: Token + Staking

```bash
./hunt ~/projects/staking-protocol/

# Finds:
# - State inconsistency between Token and Staking balances
# - Privilege escalation via unprotected Token.mint
# - Supply invariant violation in reward calculation
```

### Example 3: Proxy Pattern

```bash
./hunt ~/projects/upgradeable-contracts/

# Finds:
# - Storage collision between Proxy and Implementation
# - Re-initialization vulnerability
# - Delegatecall to user-controlled address
```

## Limitations

### What It Can Detect
- ‚úÖ Structural vulnerabilities (reentrancy, access control)
- ‚úÖ Common business logic errors
- ‚úÖ Protocol-wide invariants
- ‚úÖ Dangerous patterns (delegatecall, flash loans)

### What It Can't Detect
- ‚ùå Complex economic exploits requiring deep protocol knowledge
- ‚ùå Vulnerabilities in external dependencies (Chainlink, Uniswap)
- ‚ùå Issues in frontend or off-chain components
- ‚ùå Social engineering or governance attacks

### False Positives

The tool may flag issues that are actually safe if:
- There's custom protection logic it doesn't recognize
- The protocol design intentionally allows the pattern
- External contracts have guarantees not visible in code

**Always manually review findings!**

## Configuration

### Skip Directories

The analyzer automatically skips:
- `node_modules/`
- `lib/`
- `test/`

### Adjust Sensitivity

You can modify detection thresholds in the code:
- Confidence thresholds for each vulnerability type
- Maximum call graph depth
- State variable matching patterns

## Performance

### Scalability

- **Small projects** (< 10 contracts): < 5 seconds
- **Medium projects** (10-50 contracts): 10-30 seconds
- **Large projects** (50+ contracts): 30-60 seconds

### Memory Usage

- Analyzes contracts in memory
- No external tool dependencies for cross-contract analysis
- Lightweight parsing (regex-based)

## Integration with Other Tools

### Combine with Slither

```bash
# Run cross-contract analysis
./hunt contracts/

# Then run Slither for additional checks
slither contracts/
```

### Use with CI/CD

```bash
# In your CI pipeline
./hunt contracts/ --output cross-contract-report.json

# Parse results
python3 check_critical_vulns.py cross-contract-report.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No contracts found

**Solution:** Make sure you're pointing to a directory with `.sol` files

```bash
ls contracts/*.sol  # Check files exist
./hunt contracts/   # Run analysis
```

### Issue: Parse errors

**Solution:** The tool uses regex parsing. Complex contracts may need manual review.

### Issue: Too many false positives

**Solution:** Focus on critical and high severity findings first. Review confidence scores.
